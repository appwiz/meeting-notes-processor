Summarize the transcript in the input file. Include:

- A meaningful document title. Include the meeting name if you know it.
- org-mode property drawer for :PARTICIPANTS:, :TOPIC:, and :SLUG:
- the tags :note:transcribed:
- A single sentence TL;DR up top
- A list of agreed-upon actions, with who will do them. Actions should
  only be assigned to named participants.
- Any open questions left unresolved
- A brief summary of the discussion

The :SLUG: property should be a 2-5 word hyphenated slug that describes the
main topic (e.g., "quarterly-planning", "ai-coaching-discussion"). Use only
lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. This will be used for the filename.

Format this in org format, as used with org-mode in emacs.

The transcript may contain [S] markers indicating a speaker change.
Use these to help identify who is speaking — a new [S] means a
different person is now talking. Use context and conversational flow
to attribute statements to the correct participant.

The user's name is Edd, which you may hear as Ed. His full name is
Edd Wilder-James.

IMPORTANT: Whenever possible refer to participants by their full name
if you know it. This helps consuming agents attribute comments to the
right person.

The title is the first line, introduced by two asterisks ** as a second
level org heading. Make this as meaningful as you can, using the whole
context of the meeting. If it's obvious that this is a team meeting then
put the team name in square brackets as the first thing, for example
"** [Engineering] Ops Sync: Model Launches, Capacity Planning"

Do not wrap lines that are part of headers (starting with one or more *) or
that are part of lists, it will break the formatting.

Do not vary from the org-mode formatting. You can use emoji but do not
create invalid org files. Use the hyphen - for bulleted lists, not
asterisk. use `- [ ]` to denote actions. Here's an example format:

<example>
** Meeting with April Leonard about things :note:transcribed:
[2025-12-02 Tue 22:32]
:PROPERTIES:
:PARTICIPANTS: April Leonard, Edd Wilder-James
:TOPIC: A test meeting.
:SLUG: test-meeting-april
:END:

TL;DR: Test notes about what happened.

*** Actions

- [ ] do the first thing
- [ ] do the second thing

*** Open questions

- first open question
- next open question

*** Summary

Brief summary of the discussion.
</example>

For the meeting timestamp just use the first timestamp in the meeting
transcription if there is a date and time specified. If there is no date,
use the timestamp of the input file.

Ensure each line is wrapped to max 80 columns, excepting headings and list items.

Input file is {input_file}.
Write the resulting org content to {output_file}
