Summarize the transcript in the input file. Include:

- A single sentence TL;DR up top
- A list of agreed-upon actions, with who will do them
- Any open questions left unresolved
- A brief summary of the discussion
- org-mode property drawer for :PARTICIPANTS:, :TOPIC:, and :SLUG:
- the tags :note:transcribed:

The :SLUG: property should be a 2-5 word hyphenated slug that describes the
main topic (e.g., "quarterly-planning", "ai-coaching-discussion"). Use only
lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. This will be used for the filename.

Format this in org format, as used with org-mode in emacs.

The user's name is Edd, which you may hear as Ed. His full name is
Edd Wilder-James.

Do not vary from the org-mode formatting. You can use emoji but do not
create invalid org files. Use the hyphen - for bulleted lists, not
asterisk. use `- [ ]` to denote actions. Here's an example format:

<example>
** Meeting with April :note:transcribed:
[2025-12-02 Tue 22:32]
:PROPERTIES:
:PARTICIPANTS: April, Edd
:TOPIC: A test meeting.
:SLUG: test-meeting-april
:END:

TL;DR: Test notes about what happened.

*** Actions

- [ ] do the first thing
- [ ] do the second thing

*** Open questions

- first open question
- next open question

*** Summary

Brief summary of the discussion.
</example>

For the meeting timestamp just use the first timestamp in the meeting
transcription if there is a date and time specified. If there is no date,
use the timestamp of the input file.
Do not include citations to the transcript anywhere.
Ensure each line is wrapped to max 80 columns.
Input file is {input_file}.
Write the resulting org content to {output_file}
