Dunder Mifflin Paper Company Sales Strategy Meeting
January 15, 2025 at 9:00 AM

Michael Scott: Alright everyone, thanks for being here. We need to talk about our Q1 sales strategy. Dwight, what do you got?

Dwight Schrute: I've been analyzing our top accounts, and I believe we should focus on volume sales to our manufacturing clients. I've already prepared a 47-page presentation.

Jim Halpert: Forty-seven pages? Really?

Dwight Schrute: Quality takes time, Jim.

Pam Beesly: Maybe we could get the highlights?

Michael Scott: Good idea, Pam. Dwight, give us the elevator pitch.

Dwight Schrute: Fine. Our manufacturing clients increased purchases by 23% last quarter. We should double down on that segment. I'll personally handle the Steamtown Mall account.

Jim Halpert: I thought I had Steamtown Mall?

Dwight Schrute: You snooze, you lose, Tuna.

Michael Scott: Okay, okay, nobody's stealing anybody's accounts. Jim, what's your take on the strategy?

Jim Halpert: I think we should focus on building relationships with our existing clients. Maybe send some personalized thank you notes, schedule face-to-face meetings. Quality over quantity.

Pam Beesly: I could help design the thank you notes. Make them more personal.

Michael Scott: I love it! That's what I'm talking about. Now, Stanley, you've been quiet. What do you think?

Stanley Hudson: I think I want to make my sales, collect my commission, and go home.

Michael Scott: Classic Stanley! But seriously, do you have any input?

Stanley Hudson: Build relationships like Jim said. It's worked for me for twenty years.

Phyllis Vance: I agree with Jim and Stanley. My clients appreciate the personal touch.

Michael Scott: Okay, so here's what we're gonna do. Dwight, you focus on the volume sales with manufacturing. Jim, Phyllis, and Stanley, you work on deepening relationships with existing clients. Pam, you'll help with the thank you note campaign.

Pam Beesly: Sounds good. When do you need the designs by?

Michael Scott: End of next week?

Pam Beesly: I can do that.

Dwight Schrute: What about new client acquisition? Who's handling that?

Michael Scott: Good point. Jim, can you also identify five potential new clients by end of month?

Jim Halpert: Sure, I can do that.

Michael Scott: Alright team, let's make this the best quarter ever! Meeting adjourned.

Dwight Schrute: Actually, I have one more thing—

Michael Scott: Meeting adjourned!
