Sterling Cooper Advertising Brainstorm - Heinz Ketchup Campaign
March 8, 1965 at 10:00 AM

Don Draper: Thank you all for coming. Heinz wants something bold for their ketchup campaign. Something that breaks through the clutter. Roger, what did they say in the meeting?

Roger Sterling: They want to emphasize quality and tradition, but they're worried about looking old-fashioned. They want to feel modern without alienating their base.

Peggy Olson: What if we flip the script? Instead of showing the ketchup, we show what it goes on? A perfectly grilled burger, golden french fries, but no ketchup in sight. The tagline could be "Heinz: The only ketchup."

Don Draper: The absence creates the presence. It's bold. Keep going.

Peggy Olson: The idea is that Heinz is so iconic, you don't even need to see it to know what belongs on that burger. Everyone knows the answer.

Pete Campbell: I don't know, it might be too subtle. Testing showed that consumers respond to seeing the product.

Stan Rizzo: Testing also shows that consumers are lying half the time. They say they want one thing and buy another.

Peggy Olson: Exactly. This isn't about showing them what they expect. It's about making them feel something. Making them crave it.

Joan Holloway: I think it's clever, but we need to make sure it photographs well. The food needs to look absolutely perfect, or people won't get it.

Don Draper: Joan's right. This only works if the food looks so good that the missing element is obvious. We'll need the best food photographer in New York.

Roger Sterling: That's Frank Kostelnik. He did the Campbell's work last year.

Don Draper: Get him. Peggy, work with Stan on layouts. I want to see three different executions. Burger, fries, and... what else screams Heinz?

Peggy Olson: Hot dog? Meatloaf?

Stan Rizzo: Eggs. Lots of people put ketchup on eggs.

Don Draper: Good. Burger, fries, eggs. Three print ads, all showing the food with that conspicuous absence. Pete, I need you to prepare Heinz for this approach. They're going to be nervous.

Pete Campbell: They're definitely going to be nervous. They're paying for a ketchup ad with no ketchup in it.

Don Draper: They're paying for an idea that makes people remember Heinz every time they sit down to eat. That's worth more than another bottle shot.

Roger Sterling: How soon can we present?

Peggy Olson: I can have concepts by Friday if Stan can turn around the layouts.

Stan Rizzo: Yeah, I can do that.

Don Draper: Friday it is. One more thing - let's test a few tagline variations. "Heinz: The only ketchup," "No one grows ketchup like Heinz," and what else?

Peggy Olson: "Pass the Heinz" - it's what everyone says anyway.

Don Draper: I like that. That's three options. Let's see which one resonates. Good work, everyone. Peggy, Joan, can you stay for a minute? I want to discuss the Patio Diet Cola pitch next week.

Roger Sterling: And on that note, martinis are on me at lunch.
